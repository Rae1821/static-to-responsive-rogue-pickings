üìç What is this project about?

This was another project for the Coding Responsive Websites class at Skillcrush. 
We were given the desktop photoshop design file and had to translate that into code. 
We also were required to have clean, organized code and utilize media queries successfully so the site would look great regardless of the users screen size.

üìç Why did you want to build this project?

This was a great introduction project into using Flexbox to make sites responsive. 
I was excited for the challenge of figuring out all the spacing, typography, colors, etc just by using the Photoshop design file. 
We were given the desktop view but had to figure out how to make that look good at both the mobile and tablet viewpoints. 
It felt like a more realistic challenge in terms of working with web designers out in the real world.


üìç What hurdles/problems did you run into?

The bottom part with the three paragraphs and the borders in between gave me a bit of an issue in the beginning. 
Trying to get them to sit correctly in their section with the spacing showing up correctly took me a minute to figure out.


üìç How did you overcome these problems?

I did some more research into flex box to make sure I understood what I was doing. 
I also worked on the mobile version first since it felt easier because they are all stacked on each other at the mobile viewpoint. 
I then worked on getting the section titles lined up successfully before moving to the paragraphs below. 
Once everything was sitting in the right spot I added the borders.


üìç What did you learn from this project?

I learned more about flex box and the relationship between the parent and child divs and how that can change the the flow of the elements. 
After I took the JavaScript class I came back to this project and used my JS knowledge to make a hamburger navigation menu for the mobile version. 
Originally the navigation elements were just stacked vertically at the mobile view so it was fun to update it to a more modern look with the hamburger menu.
